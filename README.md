# Build-an-ML-powered-system-for-IT-Support-Team

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning powered system for an IT support team. The system can automatically classify incoming tickets into different categories, such as hardware, software, network, etc. The system can also generate natural language responses to the tickets, based on the ticket content and the category.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Flask 2.0.1 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.5.0 or higher
- Transformers 4.8.2 or higher
- NLTK 3.6.2 or higher
- Pandas 1.3.0 or higher
- Scikit-learn 0.24.2 or higher

## Installation

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Build-an-ML-powered-system-for-IT-Support-Team.git`
- Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Download the pretrained models and data: `python download.py`

## Usage

- Run the Flask app: `python app.py`
- Open the web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`
- Enter a ticket title and description, and click on `Submit`
- The system will display the predicted category and the generated response for the ticket
